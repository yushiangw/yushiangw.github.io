## RigidFusion: RGB-D Scene Reconstruction with Rigidly-moving Objects
#### Eurographics 2021
[[Project Website]](http://geometry.cs.ucl.ac.uk/projects/2021/rigidfusion/)  
[[Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROtMZQlaGiI)  
We introduce RigidFusion. An RGB-D reconstruction system targets dynamic environments without using object priors.

## Seeing Behind Objects for 3D Multi-Object Tracking in RGB-D Sequences
#### CVPR 2021
[[Project Website]](http://www.niessnerlab.org/projects/mueller2021completetracking.html )  
[[Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2zs9AMRxeg)  
Multi-object tracking with deep priors using RGB-D input. Our key insight is geometry completion helps tracking.

## Meaning-based Statistical Math Word Problem Solver
#### IJCAI 2017
[[Paper]]( https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/775)  
A goal-oriented meaning-based statistical framework is presented to solve the math word problem. Our system is able to generate a reasonable explanation.

## SmartAnnotator: Annotating Indoor RGBD Images
#### Eurographics 2015
[[Project Website]](http://geometry.cs.ucl.ac.uk/projects/2015/smart-annotator/)  
[[Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbdsUGWrfpo)  
We present SMARTANNOTATOR, an interactive system to facilitate annotating raw RGBD images. The system performs tedious tasks and iteratively refines user annotations.

## 3D Object Composition 
In this project, we developed a system that supports 3D object composition. It was integrated into Blender via Blenderâ€™s Python API to add special visual effects.

## Web-based Image Annotator 
This is a web-based tool that allows users to annotate 2D images. We used these tools to collect over ninety annotations. This tool was further integrated into our single-view reconstruction system.
